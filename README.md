The core backend service for the ChRIS distributed software platform, also known by the anacronym "CUBE". Internally the service is implemented as a Django-PostgreSQL project offering a [collection+json](http://amundsen.com/media-types/collection/) REST API. Important ancillary components include the ``pfcon`` and ``pman`` file transfer and remote process management microservices.


## ChRIS development, testing and deployment

### Abstract

This page describes how to quickly get the set of services comprising the ChRIS backend up and running for CUBE development and how to run the automated tests. A production deployment of the ChRIS backend services is also explained.

### Preconditions

#### Install latest Docker and Docker Compose. 

Currently tested platforms:
* ``Docker 18.06.0+``
* ``Docker Compose 1.27.0+``
* ``Ubuntu 18.04+ and MAC OS X 10.14+``

#### On a Linux machine make sure to add your computer user to the ``docker`` group

Consult this page https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/

### TL;DR

#### If you read nothing else on this page, and just want to get an instance of the ChRIS backend services up and running with no mess, no fuss:

Start a local Docker Swarm cluster if not already started:

```bash
docker swarm init --advertise-addr 127.0.0.1
```

Get the source code from CUBE repo: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FNNDSC/ChRIS_ultron_backend
cd ChRIS_ultron_backend
```

Run full CUBE instantiation with tests:
```bash
./unmake.sh ; sudo rm -fr CHRIS_REMOTE_FS; rm -fr CHRIS_REMOTE_FS; ./make.sh
```

Or skip unit and integration tests and the intro:
```bash
./unmake.sh ; sudo rm -fr CHRIS_REMOTE_FS; rm -fr CHRIS_REMOTE_FS; ./make.sh -U -I -s
```

Once the system is "up" you can add more compute plugins to the ecosystem:

```bash
./postscript.sh
```

The resulting CUBE instance uses the default Django development server and therefore is not suitable for production.


### Production deployments

For convenience a `deploy.sh` bash script is provided as part of the Github repo's source code. 
Internally the script uses the `docker stack` or `Kustomize` tools to deploy on a Swarm or Kubernetes cluster respectively.

#### Fetch the repo's source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FNNDSC/ChRIS_ultron_backend
cd ChRIS_ultron_backend
```

#### Deploy on a single-machine Docker Swarm cluster:

* Create appropriate ``secrets`` subdirectory:

```bash
mkdir swarm/prod/secrets
```

* Copy all the required secret configuration files into the ``secrets`` directory, please take a look at 
[this](https://github.com/FNNDSC/ChRIS_ultron_backEnd/wiki/ChRIS-backend-production-services-secret-configuration-files) 
wiki page to learn more about these files. 

* Deploy CUBE backend containers:

```bash
./deploy.sh up
```

* Tear down and remove CUBE backend containers:

```bash
cd ChRIS_ultron_backend
./deploy.sh down
```

#### Deploy on a Kubernetes cluster:

* Create appropriate ``secrets`` subdirectory:

```bash
mkdir kubernetes/prod/secrets
```

* Copy all the required secret configuration files into the ``secrets`` directory, please take a look at 
[this](https://github.com/FNNDSC/ChRIS_ultron_backEnd/wiki/ChRIS-backend-production-services-secret-configuration-files) 
wiki page to learn more about these files.

##### Single-machine deployment:

* Deploy CUBE backend containers:

```bash
./deploy.sh -O kubernetes up
```

* Tear down and remove CUBE backend containers:

```bash
cd ChRIS_ultron_backend
./deploy.sh -O kubernetes down
```

##### Multi-machine deployment (with NFS-based persistent storage):

* Deploy CUBE backend containers:

```bash
./deploy.sh -O kubernetes -T nfs -P <nfs_server_ip> -S <storeBase> -D <storageBase> up
```

* Both ``storeBase`` and ``storageBase`` are explained in the header documentation of the ``deploy.sh`` script.

* Tear down and remove CUBE backend containers:

```bash
cd ChRIS_ultron_backend
./deploy.sh -O kubernetes -T nfs -P <nfs_server_ip> down
```


### Development

#### Docker Swarm-based development environment:

Start a local Docker Swarm cluster if not already started:

```bash
docker swarm init --advertise-addr 127.0.0.1
```

Start CUBE from the repository source directory by running the make bash script

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FNNDSC/ChRIS_ultron_backEnd.git
cd ChRIS_ultron_backEnd
./make.sh
```
All the steps performed by the above script are properly documented in the script itself. 
After running this script all the automated tests should have successfully run and a Django development server should be running in interactive mode in this terminal.

Later you can stop and remove CUBE services and storage space by running the following bash script from the repository source directory:

```bash
./unmake.sh
```

Then remove the local Docker Swarm cluster if desired:

```bash
docker swarm leave --force
```

#### Kubernetes-based development environment:

Install single-node Kubernetes cluster. 
On MAC OS Docker Desktop includes a standalone Kubernetes server and client. 
Consult this page https://docs.docker.com/desktop/kubernetes/.
On Linux there is a simple MicroK8s installation. Consult this page https://microk8s.io.
Then create the required alias:

```bash
snap alias microk8s.kubectl kubectl
microk8s.kubectl config view --raw > $HOME/.kube/config
```

Start the Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
microk8s start
```

Start CUBE from the repository source directory by running the make bash script

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FNNDSC/ChRIS_ultron_backEnd.git
cd ChRIS_ultron_backEnd
export HOSTIP=<IP address of this machine>
./make.sh -O kubernetes
```

Later you can stop and remove CUBE services and storage space by running the following bash script from the repository source directory:

```bash
./unmake.sh -O kubernetes
```

Stop the Kubernetes cluster if desired:

```bash
microk8s stop
```

#### Rerun automated tests after modifying source code

Open another terminal and run the Unit and Integration tests within the container running the Django server:

To run only the Unit tests:

```bash
cd ChRIS_ultron_backEnd
docker-compose -f docker-compose_dev_v3.7.yml exec chris_dev python manage.py test --exclude-tag integration
```

To run only the Integration tests:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose_dev_v3.7.yml exec chris_dev python manage.py test --tag integration
```

To run all the tests:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose_dev_v3.7.yml exec chris_dev python manage.py test 
```

After running the Integration tests the ``./CHRIS_REMOTE_FS`` directory **must** be empty otherwise it means some error has occurred and you should manually empty it.


#### Check code coverage of the automated tests
Make sure the ``chris_backend/`` dir is world writable. Then type:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose_dev_v3.7.yml exec chris_dev coverage run --source=feeds,plugins,uploadedfiles,users manage.py test
docker-compose -f docker-compose_dev_v3.7.yml exec chris_dev coverage report
```

#### Using [HTTPie](https://httpie.org/) client to play with the REST API 
A simple GET request to retrieve the user-specific list of feeds:
```bash
http -a cube:cube1234 http://localhost:8000/api/v1/
```
A simple POST request to run the plugin with id 1:
```bash
http -a cube:cube1234 POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/plugins/1/instances/ Content-Type:application/vnd.collection+json Accept:application/vnd.collection+json template:='{"data":[{"name":"dir","value":"cube/"}]}'
```
Then keep making the following GET request until the ``"status"`` descriptor in the response becomes ``"finishedSuccessfully"``:
```bash
http -a cube:cube1234 http://localhost:8000/api/v1/plugins/instances/1/
```

#### Using swift client to list files in the users bucket
```bash
swift -A http://127.0.0.1:8080/auth/v1.0 -U chris:chris1234 -K testing list users
```
